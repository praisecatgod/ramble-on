#Ramble On#

**Ramble On!** is a geography trivia minigame developed in Java using custom GUI frameworks for Computer Science III (CSE 219) at Stony Brook University.

#Notes:#
- This game was made with applying certain development skills in mind, as opposed to style and practical enjoyment.
- As such, half of the data is purposefully unplayable. However, the program will not crash, and practices foolproof design!
- Some levels are unintentionally unplayable, due to the fact that many maps just have regions that are too tiny to easily click. The map data was "class sourced" by my fellow students, and much of it is imperfect in many ways.
- I honestly have no clue why the professor chose to title the project "Ramble On".

#Credits:#
- All map levels and their data were collected and created by fellow students.
- Additional programming support with audio files and frameworks provided by Professor McKenna.

#Issues:#
- "Scores" button does not respond at times. Press 'A' to manually return to that menu. May require a second press to get the music to stop.
- I honestly don't know how to get this all to work as a JAR file.
- The default win music is pretty terrible.

#Controls:#
- In "Map View", left click to go down a layer (i.e., World -> North America -> USA). Right click to go up one (i.e., USA -> North America -> World).
- Regions with no data will be shown in red. Regions with faulty data will attempt to load, but gracefully reject.
- Loading is sometimes slow, due to the large amount of images, MIDI files, and XML documents that store the data.
- Available modes will show on the side. Only Asia has valid data for all four modes.
- PRESS 'C' TO CHEAT AND REMOVE ALL ITEMS IN QUEUE BUT ONE. (If you don't see the final item, it is probably from a very large level and is traveling waaaaay down to the bottom!)

#If You Are A Current 219 Student:#
- Don't steal my code. 
- Professor McKenna updates the provided frameworks, and it won't work.
- Plus that's generally wrong. 
- Like *seriously* wrong.
- Not to mention, I TA the course (as of Spring 2014), and god help you if I see you bring me my own work. ;)
- If you are really clueless, please don't be afraid to seek help! 219 is a difficult course, and you're not alone in feeling overwhelmed. 
- But please understand that I'm uploading this project as a sample of my own work. I hope you can make code you're proud of too! And let me tell you, it's probably waaaaay better in comparison to trying to rip off some previous student's project!
